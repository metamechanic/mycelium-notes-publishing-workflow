## Bio

- Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist
- He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence
- During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking center
- He played a pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma cipher, helping the Allies win the war
- Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts and accepted chemical castration as an alternative to prison
- He died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning, ruled as suicide
