title: Albert Einstein
---

Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation." His work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.
He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing quantum theory. Einstein's contributions extend beyond physics; he was also a philosopher and advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and Zionism. His legacy continues to influence science and culture today.
